# My Neovim Configuration

Hello This is my neovim configuration (mainly various plugins, keymappings and autocommands).  
I hope it is of some use to someone 

### Installation For Linux and WSL

##### Build Latest version of neovim

Different distros provide different versions of neovim but almost always some earlier one, whereas the plugins work with the latest stable release so first we need to install the latest version  
for that you can follow the commands given on https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md
